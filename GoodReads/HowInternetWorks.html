    <title>How internet works</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
    The internet is made up of a network of computers connected to each other. In order to connect and communicate
    between computers, they must follow a set of rules, Internet Protocol(IP), that govern how data is transmitted over
    a network. Every machine on the web has a unique identifier to distinguish from one another. It’s similar to having
    a telephone number or a physical address.
    <br>
    A typical IP address(IPv4) follows the format of 4 sets of numbers between 0–255. xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx. There are a total
    of 4,294,967,296 IPv4 addresses available and 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456
    possible IPV6 addresses. Having to look for the IP address when you want to visit a webpage will take a lifetime. So
    we just type in the domain name we’re familiar with and let the magical system that is the DNS to take care of the
    rest :)
</p>

<p>
<h4>Domain Name System(DNS)</h4>

The Domain Name System is created to keep track of IP addresses for us so we can enter human-readable addresses in our
browser’s URL bar instead.

To resolve a domain name = to translate from domain name to IP address.

When you type www.holbertonschool.com in your web browser and hit enter, the request will be forwarded to a DNS server.
DNS server will then perform a DNS lookup to locate the corresponding IP address.

DNS uses a client/server architecture and the DNS servers are organized in a hierarchical and distributed fashion. It
really just means we the users are the clients requesting some kind of information from a computer somewhere that will
serve us what we asked for. And the route in which we take will look similar to a upside down tree-like structure. More
on these later.

<p>
<h4>Steps to resolving a domain name:</h4>
1. Web browser and OS will first check whether the domain is in their cache. If you’ve been to the webpage recently,
your
browser might already know the IP address and the search will end here. Otherwise, we shall continue.<br>
2. The web browser then will send a request to a DNS resolver. A DNS resolver is a local server with a central database
of
DNS nameservers. For most, DNS resolvers are hosted by a user’s Internet Service Provider (ISP). The resolver will first
check its cache. If the IP address for Holberton School of Software Engineering isn’t in its cache, it will (3)forward
the query recursively up the to the root servers, (4)down to the Top Level Domain (TLD) of Holberton School of Software
Engineering( .com would be the TLD in this case), and then (5)down to the authoritative name servers responsible for
www.holbertonschool.com.
<br>
3. So earlier we talked about how the DNS system is organized in an upside down tree-like structure. We will go to
the top and search downward. First stop is the root servers. Root servers respond with address to the .com Top-Level
Domain(TLD). Top-level domain just refers to the last chunk of a domain name after the dot symbol. Here we go to the
.com TLD, but other examples are .org, .edu, .gov, etc.
<br>
4. The resolver then queries .com servers for the authoritative name servers of our domain, Holberton School of
Software
Engineering. The authoritative name servers are the ones with the answer to our search. They hold the actual DNS
records and will provide the IP address of our query.
<br>
5. So now the resolver will be able to query the authoritative name servers. Holberton School of Software Engineering’s
authoritative name servers contain all DNS records within the domain.
<br>
6. Authoritative name servers will respond with the corresponding IP address of www.holbertonschool.com, allowing the
local DNS servers to pass along to the user. But first, it will save this IP to its cache. Caching every step of the
way!
<br>
7. The user’s operating system will also cache this IP address for reference in the future — in case you want to visit
this website again to finish your Holberton application :)
<br>
8. The user’s web browser can now follow HTTP protocol and send a GET request to the server at holbertonschool.com’s
corresponding IP address.
</p>
<img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6361c570af5bdb11c3bbeeaf953acb0a">
<p>
    Client sends GET request and waits for server to respond when request is completed
    <br>
    Redundancy: There are multiple DNS servers at each level. Having redundancy ensures requests will still be processed
    if one of the servers fail.
    <br>
    Client — Server:
    Machines used to serve other machines are called servers and machines used to request service are called clients.
</p>

<p>
<h4>TCP Model</h4>
Now that we have the right IP address, we need to send a request to the server at that location to get our webpage. We
can follow the TCP model and organize the next few steps into layers conceptually to make things a little easier to
understand.
<br><br>
We start at the application layer — user interface. This is where we enter the URL in browser and where DNS lookup takes
place. Once we have the actual address, we(client) can send HTTP request to server at that address and server will
respond with the corresponding data. Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol used for
transmitting files/data across the web through TCP/IP sockets.
<br><br>
TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) resides in the transport layer and is responsible for creating a reliable end-to-end
connection between two hosts. It’s similar to a messenger. Allows data transfers of other protocols(like HTTP). TCP will
break the data down into smaller packets and then reassemble them at the other end. We can use the analogy of picking up
cookies from grandma’s house. IP would be the road on which we drive. TCP would be the car. And HTTP would be the box of
cookies moving from one location to another.

<p>
<h4>TCP/IP</h4>
HTTP relies on TCP to establish a reliable connection between client and server. Four pieces of information are needed
to establish a TCP connection (TCP Connection tuple):
<br>1. Client IP address
<br>2. Client Port number
<br>3. Source IP address
<br>4. Source Port number
<br>An IP address will identify the device, but a port number is also needed to identify the specific
application/service. It’s similar to having an address to an apartment and a specific unit number.
<br>IP + port number = socket
<br>A web server will bind its application to a port and listen for connection requests. HTTP protocol uses port 80 as
default so web servers typically bind to their port 80. On the other hand, the client’s web browser does not need to
bind specifically to a port so it will bind to one randomly and send the HTTP request to port 80 of the web server’s IP.
<br>Holbertonschool.com is a secured website so will be using port 443 instead.
</p>


<p>
<h4>TCP Connection</h4>
<br>To make a TCP connection, the client will attempt to connect with the server at the specified port. If the server
accepts the connection request, the connection with client will occur on a new socket. This allows the server to
continuously listen to its port for other requests whilst communicating with a client.
<br>A three-way handshake is used to establish a TCP connection: Client initiates TCP handshake by sending a segment
with SYN(Synchronize Sequence Number) flag set to 1.
<br>Server will either accept or decline the connection. To accept, server will open ports and respond with a SYN-AWK
segment (with SYN and AWK flags set to 1) - acknowledging client’s segment and sending a SYN segment indicating the
sequence number with which to start.
<br>Client sends an AWK segment back acknowledging server’s messages and will then start data transfer.
<h5>
    Client ->->->->->-SYN->->->->->-> Server
    <br>Client <-<-<-<-<-ACK/SYN<-<-<-<-<-Server
    <br>Client->->->->->-ACK->->->->->-> Server
</h5>

<h4>SSL</h4>
<br>Without secured connection, communication between client and server is vulnerable. SSL is a security protocol that
establishes a secure connection between a client and server.
<img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-aa3d74f45119cd070a4a7c1101e6c7f9">
<br>SSL secured websites will have a lock icon on the left side of the URL
Notice the protocol stated on the left is HTTPS as opposed to HTTP. HTTPS uses the same HTTP protocol but with an added
SSL/TLS encryption.
<br>In order for this to work, both the browser and the server need SSL Certificates. Since Holberton School of Software
Engineering is an SSL-secured website, we will need an SSL Certificate and establish the connection through an SSL
Handshake.
<br>Secure Sockets Layer(SSL) / Transportation Layer Security(TLS) is an updated, more ecure version of SSL. Though this
is still more commonly refered to as SSL.
<br>SSL uses asymmetric encryption (public key for encryption, private key for decryption) first to generate a symmetric
key. Communication will then use symmetric encryption (shared key). Due to asymmetric encryption’s heavy computational
costs, it is only used to exchange and generate a symmetric key safely.

<p>
<h4>SSL handshake starts after successful TCP connection:</h4>
<br><br>Client hello: Client (browser) sends a client hello message with information such as a random byte string (will
be used to symmetry key session), highest SSL version browser can support, compression methods it supports, cipher suite
it supports, etc).
<br><br>Server hello: based off the client’s hello message, server sends a server hello message containing the chosen
cipher suite, compression method, and SSL version as well as a random byte string.
<br><br>Asymmetric encryption server authentication and key exchange:
Server sends client its digital certificate containing its public key for client to encrypt its data before sending to
the server.
Server may request for client’s certificate to establish identity of the client(but optional).
<br><br>Client verifies server’s certificate and sends a random byte string (session key, premaster secret) encrypted
with the server’s public key(server will be able to decrypt with server’s private key). If the server requested client’s
certificate, client will send its certificate along.
<br><br>Symmetric encryption
<br>Server verifies client certificate and decrypts client’s premaster secret(encrypted with server’s public key) with
the server’s private key and will then generate a symmetric key(master secret).
<br><br>Client will generate the same symmetric key and send a change cipher spec message (changing to symmetric
encryption) to the server and a client finish message.
<br><br>Server follows with a change cipher message and server finish message. The server finish message will be
encrypted with the shared symmetric key. Connection is now secured. Yay :)
</p>


<p>
<h4>Firewall</h4>
<br>TCP network breaks data into chunks (packets). Along with data, a packet will have a header including control
information such as source address, destination address, connection state, etc. (The packet receiver must send out a
confirmation to the sender upon receiving a packet).
<br>A server’s firewall can use the information provided by packets to filter what permeates through.
<br>Packets rejected by firewall will be dropped into the abyss
<br><br>Methods:<br>
Packet filtering (stateless): firewall compares packets to predetermine filters. If a packet is flagged by the filters,
it will be discarded here. Firewall allows or denies packets based on individual packet headers regardless of connection
state. This is often used on small business and home networks.
<br><br>Stateful inspection: Firewall collects related packets until a connection state is determined. Incoming
information is compared to characteristics of trusted/specific characteristics. It keeps records of all connections
passing through in order to better assess incoming packets.
<br><br>Application/Proxy service: Firewall analyzes data with a packet and match against specific predetermined rules
to specific services/applications. A proxy is a file server located outside of a firewall. A proxy server has its own
IP. It takes a client’s request and sends to the requesting server so the client actually never interacts directly with
the requesting server’s IP.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Load Balancer</h4>
<br><br>After a packet makes past the firewall, it is likely to encounter a load balancer. The job of a load balancer is
to…. balance loads. When you have a single server handling all client requests, a large volume of traffic may overwork
the server and cause delays /connection issues. The server alone is also a single point of failure in this case — if the
server is down for whatever reason, users will no longer be able to access the website. Having a load balancer means
workload can be distributed across servers. If one fails, others will carry on. Load balancers handle HTTP, HTTPS, TCP,
and UDP traffic. They manage traffic by load balancing algorithms and server health checks.
<br><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c22de2dfa83f73b45db752afe35a8f99">
<br><br>Some common load balancing algorithms are Round Robin, Least Connections, and Source.
<br>Round Robin: sequential selection. Load balancer will choose the first server for the first request, down the line,
and repeat.
<br>Least Connections: Select server with least amount of active sessions at time of selection.
<br>Source: Select based on a hash of the source IP of the request. This allows client request to go to the same server
it used previously.
</p>

<p>
<h4>Web Server, Application Server, Database</h4>
<br><br>After load balancer selected and forwarded our request to a server, our HTTP request will be processed by its
web server.
<br>Server VS Web Server:
<br>A server is a computer designed to process requests and deliver data to other computers over a local network or the
internet.
<br>Web servers supply the web content for web browsers; what the browser requests, the web server delivers through
Internet network connections.
<br><br>Static VS dynamic content:
<br>Static content: already processed(HTML pages, images, etc) file and need not further processing. A web server can
directly retrieve data from codebase if static content is requested.
<br>Dynamic content: needs to be compiled/process into a HTML file first before web server can process it.
<br><br>If client requests for a dynamic file, web server will need to forward the request to an application server to
process the dynamic content into HTML and retrieve data from the database if needed. Once processed, the application
server can communicate and return the processed content to the web server.
<br><br><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-801affeedc861ec309dfd47530011550">
<br><br>Application servers host and execute applications and can be used to communicate and extract data from a
database — A database is a data repository that stores information. An Application server accesses a database using SQL
(Structured Query Language) though data access drivers.
<br><br>Once content is processed, web server will reply to the client with the requested content and an HTTP response.
The status code within the HTTP response’s header will indicate whether the request was successfully completed.
